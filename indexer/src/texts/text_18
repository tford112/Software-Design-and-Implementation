Students present their work during the Spring 2017 "Computer Science Unleashed" event. The Digital Arts Expo (DAX) is a two-day showcase of work that lives at the intersection of arts, technology, design, and interactivity created by Dartmouth students, alumni, and guest artists. Delivers the information technology services that enable Dartmouth to offer exceptional teaching, excel in research and scholarship, and support outstanding student achievement. Engages in interdisciplinary research, education, and outreach programs that focus on information technology (IT) and its role in society, particularly the impact of IT in security and privacy. Dartmouth is a member of I3Pâ€”an organization that brings together researchers, government officials, and industry representatives to address cyber security challenges. Supports a broad view of computational investigation across campus and catalyzes creative thought throughout the arts and sciences, engineering, medicine, and business, for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty. Equips students with the tools necessary to not only fully comprehend modern computational technologies (software and hardware), but also innovate in this exciting space, enabling students to develop new technologies that improve the world around them. Serves as a focal point between industry and academic research on campus by transferring technology, originated in the College and its professional schools, to the private sector for the benefit of the general public and by contributing to the educational, research, and public service missions of the College. Technology support for Geisel School of Medicine faculty, students, and staff. Technology support for Thayer School of Engineering faculty, students, and staff. Technology support for Tuck School of Business faculty, students, and staff.
