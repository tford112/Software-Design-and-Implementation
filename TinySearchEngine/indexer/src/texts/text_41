Welcome home. Nearly 90 percent of Dartmouth undergraduates live and learn together in residence halls; approved co-ed, fraternity, sorority houses, or undergraduate society houses; and affinity houses centered on academic or personal interests. Campus residence halls are grouped into clusters—including the East Wheelock cluster—and supervised by live-in community directors. Students arrive on campus on move-in day. Residence halls include common areas for study. Students prepare a meal in the Sustainable Living Center, one of Dartmouth’s affinity programs that bring students together around an academic or cultural interest. On-campus housing for undergraduates is offered within communities designed to enhance students’ academic and social experiences. Living learning communities foster a holistic and integrative learning process as part of the residential experience. More than 3,000 undergraduates live in campus residence halls, which are grouped into clusters and supervised by full-time, live-in community directors. All first-year students live on first-year floors (Russell Sage, McLaughlin, and East Wheelock), or in all first-year residence hall clusters (the River and the Choates). From sustainability to German, affinity housing brings students together around a shared academic or cultural interest. The majority of Dartmouth’s Greek Letter organizations offer residential facilities for members in houses, apartments, or group space on a residence hall floor. Everything you need to know about living in the residence halls—from the keys to your door to how to recycle or store your stuff—and who can help.
