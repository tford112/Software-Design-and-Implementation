Define yourself. As a sophomore at Dartmouth you’ll declare a major in an academic program that excites you intellectually. You can combine any of more than 60 majors with your pick of minors; fine-tune a major by adding studies from other departments and programs; or design a special major around your particular passion. With or without a minor in another field most majors call for between eight and 10 courses and a culminating project. Browse all undergraduate majors offered at Dartmouth. A modified major combines work in two subjects with emphasis on one—such as “economics modified with history”—to create a unified coherent program of study. Students have the option to complete the requirements for two—or even three—distinct majors. Special majors are student-designed programs of study involving two or more departments or programs and one to three terms of independent study or research. When you add a minor to your academic portfolio the options to tailor your studies to your interests are nearly limitless.
