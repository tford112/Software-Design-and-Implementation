Section navigation “What are we aiming at?” That’s the question our university’s first president Daniel Coit Gilman asked at  his inauguration in 1876 . What is this place all about exactly? His answer: “The encouragement of research . . . and the advancement of individual scholars who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue and the society where they dwell.” Gilman believed that  teaching  and  research  go hand in hand—that success in one depends on success in the other—and that a modern university must do both well. He also believed that sharing our  knowledge  and  discoveries  would help make the world a better place. In 140 years we haven’t strayed from that vision. This is still a destination for excellent ambitious scholars and a world leader in teaching and research. Distinguished professors mentor students in the arts and music humanities social and natural sciences engineering international studies education business and the health professions. Those same faculty members along with their colleagues at the university’s Applied Physics Laboratory have made us the nation’s leader in federal research and development funding every year since 1979. That’s a fitting distinction for  America’s first research university  a place that has revolutionized higher education in the U.S. and continues to bring knowledge and discoveries to the world.
