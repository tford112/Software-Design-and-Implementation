Museums restaurants concert venues coffee houses and one-of-kind shops  are just a short walk or a free shuttle ride away from our four Baltimore campuses. A city with a rich history as a working-class port Baltimore has blossomed into a hub of social cultural and economic activity but retains the small-town feel that has earned it the nickname Charm City. From popular tourist attractions—the Inner Harbor the National Aquarium or Fort McHenry (birthplace of “The Star Spangled Banner”)—to more off-the-beaten path destinations—the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum or the tranquil Sherwood Gardens—there is always something new to discover. See how Johns Hopkins is making a difference in Baltimore from our volunteer service efforts to our more than $5 billion in economic output Our students enjoy exploring Baltimore many neighborhoods including Charles Village and Hampden (home to the  famous holiday lights on 34th Street  and the colorful quirky Honfest); Mount Vernon and Station North a prime destination for artists and arts enthusiasts alike; the  historic waterfront neighborhoods  of Fells Point Canton and Federal Hill. The city hosts events both big and small throughout the year. Baltimore sports fans are passionate about their Orioles and the Ravens; sci-fi lovers can geek out at  Baltimore Comic-Con ; and hundreds drop by the  Baltimore Farmer’s Market  each Sunday to pick up fresh local meats cheeses flowers and produce (and perhaps a cup of locally roasted Zeke’s coffee too). There’s the  Maryland Film Festival  each spring a  book festival  each fall and  Artscape —America’s largest free crafts festival—in the summer.
