Our commitment to our local communities is based on the simple truth that the health and well being of the university is inextricably tied to the physical social and economic well being of the city in which we live. Our founder and namesake Johns Hopkins put forth that idea when he made a bequest to establish a university and a hospital. As  the city’s largest anchor institution  Johns Hopkins feels the constant pull of urban issues. Our faculty staff students and administrators answer the call on a daily basis in ways both large and small from volunteering as tutors in local schools to contributing nearly $5 billion in economic output in the city. Johns Hopkins’ commitment to our city and our neighbors is not new;  it is part of who we are  inherent in our work from clinics to classrooms. And in the wake of the unrest in Baltimore [in spring 2015]—a moment that laid bare harsh and multi-generational inequalities—our work is ever more important.
