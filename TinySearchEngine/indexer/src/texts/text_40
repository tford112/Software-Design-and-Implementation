And you add further dimensions with contrasting colors and intensity and shadows. — For every performance that graces the stage of Shriver Hall you can typically find Heather Michaelson up at the top of the balcony at work in her control booth. As tech coordinator of the 1100-seat Homewood campus venue she's in charge of making sure everything you see and hear when you're in the audience is on point. "Anything and everything for lights sound and AV falls under me" says Michaelson who started the job in early 2019. It's a new position at Johns Hopkins created to coincide with the  recent $14 million renovation  of the historic campus performance space. Michaelson comes to this job with a varied background that includes theaters classrooms cruise ships and most recently a stint at Baltimore's Live! Casino & Hotel. In Shriver Hall she's overseen dance shows student-run speaker series  The Nutcracker  and comedy. "There's really no such thing as a typical event" Michaelson says. "For any performance or speaking event that happens here—whether they need full lighting programmed or they just need a microphone—I'm taking care of that. My big thing is making sure everything is prepped beforehand so I coordinate with event organizers." Read more about Heather Michaelson and her work
