Learn more about the leading scholars pursuing big ideas at Hopkins as part of the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships program The majority of Bloomberg’s gift is dedicated to creating  50 interdisciplinary professorships.  The Bloomberg Professors bridge the university’s academic divisions conduct and stimulate innovative research that crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries and train a new generation of native “interdisciplinarians.” The program is currently recruiting top researchers from around the world with a goal of having all 50 Bloomberg Professors at Johns Hopkins by the end of 2018. When you think about a lot of issues we face in contemporary society—whether you’re looking at environmental issues the challenges of global development cities that work or cities that don’t work—it’s clear that you can’t solve these problems through the perspective of one school or one department acting alone. What you need is to bring several scholarly approaches together.
