Section navigation As an institution with a long-standing tradition of crossing academic boundaries and making new discoveries that have shaped the world around us our commitment to supporting the best and brightest students is at the core of our mission. Undergraduate students at Hopkins are admitted through a need-blind process meaning their ability to pay is not considered as part of the admissions process and receive loan-free financial aid packages that meet 100% of demonstrated financial need.Â This allows them to graduate debt-free and with the freedom to pursue whatever path their ambitions dictate. Our generous financial aid program allows us to provide transformative experiences for the most talented students and in turn allows them to use the unique opportunities at Hopkins to make a lasting impact on the world.
