Section navigation We are  America’s first research university  founded on the principle that by pursuing big ideas and sharing what we learn we can make the world a better place. For more than 140 years our faculty and students have worked side by side in pursuit of discoveries that improve lives. What kinds of discoveries? We made water purification possible launched the field of genetic engineering and authenticated the Dead Sea Scrolls. We invented saccharine CPR and the supersonic ramjet engine. Our efforts have resulted in child safety restraint laws; the creation of Dramamine Mercurochrome and rubber surgical gloves; and the development of a revolutionary surgical procedure to correct heart defects in infants. The research opportunities here are just endless. That’s really what I was looking for a place where  it’s very easy to do research . Researchers at our nine academic divisions and at the university’s Applied Physics Laboratory have made us the nation’s leader in federal research and development funding each year since 1979. Those same researchers mentor our inquisitive students—about two-thirds of our undergrads engage in some form of research during their time here. Research isn’t just something we do—it’s who we are. Every day our faculty and students work side by side in a tireless pursuit of discovery continuing our founding mission to bring knowledge to the world. Johns Hopkins researchers contribute to breakthrough study showing likely biological link between Zika virus and microcephaly a birth defect linked to abnormally small head size and stunted brain development in newborns.
