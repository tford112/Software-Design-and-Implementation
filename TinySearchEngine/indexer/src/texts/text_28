Founded in 1769, Dartmouth is a member of the Ivy League and consistently ranks among the world’s greatest academic institutions. Dartmouth has forged a singular identity for combining its deep commitment to outstanding undergraduate liberal arts and graduate education with distinguished research and scholarship in the Arts and Sciences and its four leading graduate schools—the Geisel School of Medicine, the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies, Thayer School of Engineering, and the Tuck School of Business. Dartmouth College educates the most promising students and prepares them for a lifetime of learning and responsible leadership, through a faculty dedicated to teaching and the creation of knowledge.

Hanlon '77 became the 18th president of Dartmouth College on June 10, 2013. He is the 10th Dartmouth alumnus to serve as its president and the first since the 1981-to-1987 tenure of David T. McLaughlin '54, Tuck '55. President Hanlon, previously the Donald J. Lewis Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, earned his bachelor of arts degree from Dartmouth, from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa. An accomplished academic and administrative leader, Hanlon had been a Michigan faculty member since 1986 and served in a succession of administrative leadership roles there for more than a decade, most recently as the provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. As a mathematician, Hanlon focuses on probability and combinatorics, the study of finite structures and their significance as they relate to bioinformatics, computer science, and other fields. Hanlon has earned numerous honors and awards for his mathematical research, including a Sloan Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Henry Russel Award, and the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and held an Arthur F. Thurnau Professorship, the University of Michigan's highest recognition of faculty whose commitment to undergraduate teaching has had a demonstrable impact on the intellectual development of their students. Hanlon is married to Gail Gentes. The couple have three children.

Founded in 1797, Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine ranks among the nation's top medical schools and is known for pioneering many advancements in education, research, and patient care. Geisel encompasses 18 clinical and basic science departments, and draws on the resources of Dartmouth College and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. In addition to the MD degree, the Geisel School offers graduate education in the biomedical sciences and public health, as well as health care delivery science in conjunction with the Tuck School of Business. The Frank J. Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies was created in 2018 and is the first new school established at Dartmouth in more than a century. However, the graduate arts and sciences program has a long history at Dartmouth; the first Dartmouth PhD was awarded in classics in 1885, and the first modern doctoral programs began in the 1960s. More than 700 students are enrolled in graduate programs in the Arts and Sciences. Thayer School of Engineering comprises both the undergraduate Department of Engineering Sciences and a professional school with degrees through the doctorate. Tuck School of Business is the first graduate school of management in the country and consistently ranks among the top business schools worldwide. Tuck offers a full-time MBA as well as executive education and a number of nondegree programs. Dartmouth undergraduates have the opportunity to study in 46 faculty-led off-campus programs in 25 countries. About half of undergraduates take part in an off-campus program at least once during their Dartmouth career. Dartmouth was founded in 1769 by the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock for "the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land ... and also of English Youth and any others." The Supreme Court decision in the famous "Dartmouth College Case" of 1819, argued by Daniel Webster (Class of 1801), is considered to be one of the most important and formative documents in United States constitutional history, strengthening the contract clause of the Constitution and thereby paving the way for all American private institutions to conduct their affairs in accordance with their charters and without interference from the state. Dartmouth became coeducational in 1972, and was named by the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton as one of the world's "most enduring institutions" in 2004. Nearly 25 percent of students participate in intercollegiate athletics. Dartmouth offers 35 intercollegiate varsity sports (18 women's, 16 men's, one coed) at the NCAA Division I level, and 35 club sports. Including intramural sports, three-quarters of Dartmouth undergraduates participate in some form of athletics. The 62,700 alumni of the undergraduate college, from around the world, make up the bulk of Dartmouth's 83,700 alumni, including the graduate and professional programs. The alumni annual fund giving rate in fiscal year 2019 was 41 percent. As of June 30, 2019, the endowment was valued at $5.7 billion. Dartmouth College is accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (CIHE) of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).
