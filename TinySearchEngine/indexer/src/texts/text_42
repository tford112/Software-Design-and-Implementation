Hyder’s doctors diagnosed him with transverse myelitis—paralysis that sets in after a viral infection—and gave him little hope that he’d walk again. But Hyder defied the odds: With physical therapy restorative nerve transfer surgeries and hard work he regained the ability to walk and is now a member of the Class of 2022 at Johns Hopkins University. Choosing Hopkins was a “no brainer” Hyder says because of the ongoing rehabilitation he receives at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Kennedy Krieger Institute while pursuing his passion for neuroscience at the university. On the pre-med track Hyder wants to become a neurologist who treats people with spinal cord injuries while finding a cure for paralysis. “Interacting with people who are leaders in their fields and are hungry to advance knowledge is what makes Hopkins special to me” Hyder says. “Never before have I been surrounded by such highly motivated individuals who inspire me to be my best.”
