The D-Plan: Pick a term, any term. With Dartmouth’s distinctive year-round system, you customize your own academic calendar. Dartmouth offers four 10-week terms per year; within some guidelines, you choose which 12 terms to enroll. The result: the ability to take full advantage of all Dartmouth has to offer, no matter the season. The D-Plan, Dartmouth’s year-round, flexible academic system, makes it possible to customize your enrollment pattern. No matter what your major, and whatever engages you outside the classroom, the D-Plan's flexibility means you don't have to choose between your on-campus commitments and the opportunity to work, study, or serve off-campus and abroad.Your D-Plan is your personal enrollment pattern, your own mix of academic terms in residence, enrolled off-campus, and on leave. Rising juniors are on campus together taking a full slate of courses during the summer following their sophomore year. Use the entire year to your advantage—gain work experience in an internship, volunteer on a service project, or conduct field research. A number of Dartmouth programs even offer funding for leave-term opportunities. Take your education on the road with Dartmouth's extensive selection of language and topic-focused programs around the world.
