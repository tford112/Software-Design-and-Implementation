Section navigation As America’s first research university we take learning seriously and we have the libraries and study spaces to help fuel discovery—from the stately Hutzler Reading Room to the open and modern Brody Learning Commons. The Brody Learning Commons opened in 2012 and was  built with our students in mind . A focal point of activity (both studious and social) it contains 16 group study rooms a 75-seat café a 100-seat quiet reading room and the thing our students told us they wanted more than anything else— lots of natural light . The 24/7  building is also environmentally friendly and was  recognized for its green construction and operations  by the U.S. Green Building Council. Our state-of-the-art Brody Learning Commons is designed to encourage technology-driven and collaborative learning The adjacent (and more traditional)  Milton S. Eisenhower Library  is the main research  library  for the university. Home to our incredibly helpful librarians (the original search engines) the stacks and our impressive collection of rare books and manuscripts the library is one of the most heavily used buildings on campus. The  George Peabody Library  also known as “the cathedral of books” holds some 300000 volumes mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries and is routinely ranked  among the most beautiful libraries in the world . The ornate cast-iron balconies rise to a latticed skylight above a black-and-white-marble-floored atrium providing an Instagram-worthy and inspiring place to connect to the past. With spaces both traditional and modern and world-class resources—from rare books to the latest electronic databases and millions of print volumes—the university libraries help make discovery possible around the clock across our campuses and around the world. The holdings of all of our libraries are available in the Johns Hopkins University Libraries Catalog The Sheridan Libraries —made up of the  Brody Learning Commons  the  Milton S. Eisenhower Library  and its collections at the  Albert D. Hutzler Reading Room  in Gilman Hall the  John Work Garrett Library  at Evergreen and the  George Peabody Library  at Mount Vernon Place—provide the major research library resources for the university. Together they contain more than 3.7 million books and provide round-the-clock access to a rich collection of electronic resources including more than 171000 print and e-journals and more than 900000 e-books. Other university libraries: Hopkins really does encourage learning with others community learning. It tries to foster that.
